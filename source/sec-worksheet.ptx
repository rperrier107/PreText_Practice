        <introduction>
            <p>
                Overview: Markov Chains are a way of measuring the probability of repeated 
                iterations of an event. We learn about 
                transition matrices, powers of those 
                matrices, and steady states.

            Tasks for In-Class:
            <!--This currently goes off the page in print mode.  Consider making the initial problem situation as an introduction
                (or paragraph) and then make each task their own exercise. I can then break up activities over multiple pages.
                At this time, there is not a way to break pages among different tasks.-->

                <introduction><p>
                    Consider a situation where a rental car company has two locations, <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>, and customers have the ability to rent from either location and return to either location.  Suppose that <m>80\%</m> of the cars rented from <m>P</m> are returned to <m>P</m> and <m>60\%</m> of the cars rented from <m>Q</m> are returned to <m>Q</m>.
